//
// Only one of them changes a number. An acknowledged /low-priority retires the
// 5-hour wall - the session carries straight past that reset at lower priority,
// spending the weekly - so the window that actually stops the work becomes the
// weekly, and the brief has to brake on that one instead. The swap happens here,
// once, so the pressure, the relay and the sentence all describe the same
// window; doing it in three places is how they come to describe two.
//
// Never on a guess. `acknowledged` means the user said so through
// usage-mode --low-priority on, and that record lapses at the reset of the
// window it was recorded against. Whether low-priority is really running is in
// the CLI's process memory and readable nowhere; see lowpri.js.
// Claude Code only, and settled before a single file is read.
//
// Every one of these features is Claude Code's: /low-priority and /limit-reset
// are its slash commands, the wrap-up note is its injection, and
// autoContinueAtUsageLimit is its setting. None of them exist in Codex or in
// Antigravity, and ~/.claude.json describes an account neither of them is
// running on. Reading it from inside another host would put a Claude Code
// command in front of an agent that cannot type it, against a window it is not
// spending - the same mistake as naming /effort in Codex, which this plugin is
// otherwise careful never to make.

// is still allowed. The default stays null - discoverable, not imposed.
//
// It never scans. The snapshot, plus whatever correction an earlier turn has
// already paid for, and nothing else: a mode whose promise is that the plugin
// costs nothing cannot buy its one line with a five-second transcript scan.

//
//   The windows come from snapshotWindows(), not from `utilization.limits`

//   reader here works from the top-level five_hour/seven_day keys - so a guard
//   wired to it was silent at 97 per cent used on the payload shape everything
//   else treats as primary.
//
//   A per-model weekly for a model this session is not running cannot be the
//   window that stops the work, so it cannot be the thing that fires the
//   guard either. Without the applies filter it fired at 99 per cent on an
//   Opus weekly for a user with 80 per cent of their real budget left - the
