// There are two ways to know how much of a window is gone. The snapshot is what
// the account last told us, and it is free to read. The correction is the spend
// measured out of the transcripts since that snapshot was taken, and it costs a
// scan of up to several seconds - far too much for something that redraws under
// the prompt on every keystroke.
//
// So the fast readers used the snapshot alone, and during a heavy session that
// is not a small error. Measured on a real session: the snapshot said 13 per
// cent while the same codebase, given a scan, said 73. The status line is the
// number a person actually looks at, and it was sixty points wrong, in the
// flattering direction, for twenty minutes.
//
// The fix is not to make the cheap path expensive. It is to notice that
// something already paid for the scan - the prompt hook before every turn, the
// pulse hook during long ones - and to have it leave the answer here. One small
// file, one object per window key, and the readers prefer it whenever it is
// fresher than the snapshot it would otherwise trust.
